    <h1>Site Down, Nameservers Issue</h1>
    <p>I am having trouble reaching my website http://example.com/ from different networks. Are your nameservers working properly?</p>
    <p>Response:</p>
    <p>Based on the issue described, it's important to check the current status of your nameservers to ensure they are functioning correctly and resolving DNS queries for your domain. Here's how we can proceed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify the DNS configuration in your Cloudflare dashboard to ensure the nameservers are correctly set up for your domain.</li>
        <li>Check for any recent updates or changes that might have affected the DNS resolution.</li>
        <li>Review any recent incidents or outages reported on Cloudflare's status page that might be impacting nameserver functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please provide the specific domain name or account details so we can investigate further and provide more targeted assistance.</p>
